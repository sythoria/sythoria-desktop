## Local Development Setup

Sythoria is a cross-platform desktop application built using **Tauri v2 (Rust)** and **React 19 (TypeScript)**.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

1. **Node.js** (v20 or newer) & **npm**
2. **Rust** stable toolchain (installed via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
3. **Git**
4. **Platform-Specific Dependencies**:
   - **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**: Tauri requires certain system libraries for compilation:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install -y build-essential curl wget file libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
     ```
   - **macOS**: Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
     ```bash
     xcode-select --install
     ```
   - **Windows**: Install the C++ Build Tools via Visual Studio Installer.

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sythoria-desktop.git
   cd sythoria-desktop
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   _Note: This automatically initializes Git Hooks using **Husky** to ensure automatic linting and formatting on commit._

3. **Run the Application in Development Mode**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```
   This compiles the Rust backend, starts the Vite frontend dev server (port 1420), and launches the Tauri desktop window.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Branch Naming Conventions

Always create a new branch from `main` for your changes. Use descriptive prefixes followed by a short summary:

- `feature/your-feature-name` (new features or enhancements)
- `bugfix/issue-description` (bug fixes)
- `docs/update-readme` (documentation updates)
- `chore/upgrade-deps` (maintenance, refactoring, dependencies)

### 2. Commit Message Guidelines

We follow **Conventional Commits** for clean and readable repository history. Your commits should be prefixed with an appropriate type:

- `feat:` A new feature for the user
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation-only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, white-space, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process, tool configs, or auxiliary tools/libraries

_Example:_

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add keyboard shortcut for sidebar toggle"
```

## Coding Guidelines & Standards

### Frontend (React & TypeScript)

- **Formatting**: We use **Prettier** for code formatting. You can check or apply formatting using:
  ```bash
  npm run format:check  # Check files
  npm run format        # Apply formatting
  ```
- **Linting**: We use **ESLint 9 (flat config)**. Rules are checked automatically before commit, or manually via:
  ```bash
  npm run lint          # Run linter
  npm run lint:fix      # Automatically fix autofixable issues
  ```
- **Type Checking**: Ensure TypeScript compiles cleanly:
  ```bash
  npm run typecheck
  ```
- **Animations**: Use the motion system defined in `src/lib/motion-tokens.ts` and the `use-safe-motion.ts` hooks to ensure animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and perform well on low-end hardware.

### Backend (Rust)

- Follow standard Rust style. Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` in `src-tauri` to ensure your backend code is clean and idiomatic.

---

## Testing & Verification

Before submitting a Pull Request, verify that all tests pass:

### Frontend Unit Tests

We use **Vitest** with JSDOM for testing React components and Zustand stores:

```bash
npm run test          # Run tests once
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
```

### Rust Backend Tests

Run the Rust unit and integration tests:

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo test
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Verify your build locally**: Ensure `npm run build` compiles without errors.
2. **Push your branch**: Push the feature branch to your fork.
3. **Open a Pull Request**: Submit your PR targeting the `main` branch of the original repository.
4. **Describe the changes**:
   - Provide a clear summary of what your changes do.
   - Mention any related issues (e.g., `Closes #12`).
   - If your changes affect the UI, include before/after screenshots or GIFs.
5. **Participate in Code Review**: Address reviewer feedback and make updates to your branch as needed.
